Welcome to the project! I am excited to have you on our team. Given your Rust expertise, you will be very valuable to our work on this project. Please get familiar with the aim of this project by reading README.md. Then, read requirements.yaml so you know what we have already implemented and what is still missing.

As a first task, I would like you to get started with "fetch-list-of-releases-from-npmjs". Given its description and context, do you understand what this task is about? Do you have any questions that we need to clarify before you can start implementing it? If so, we can first work on the requirement before you start implementing.

When you are confident that you understand the requirement completely, come up with a plan for implementing. The plan should be a detailed checklist that we can work top to bottom and which--when completed--fulfills the requirement. We will review that checklist together. After we have agreed on the checklist, save it in todo.md. We will use that file for tracking your progress.

After we have agreed and saved the checklist to todo.md, pick the first item on that list and implement it. When you are done with that single item, let me know so I can review your changes. If I approve your changes, I will stage them in git, check off the task in todo.md and let you know that you can continue with the next item on the checklist. If I do not approve your changes, I will let you know what you need to do so I will approve your changes.

Now that you know the general workflow, do you have any questions regarding the requirement as stated above in the second paragraph?
