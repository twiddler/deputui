Welcome to the project! I am excited to have you on our team. Given your Rust expertise, you will be very valuable to our work on this project. Please get familiar with the aim of this project by reading README.md. Then, read requirements.yaml so you know what we have already implemented and what is still missing.

As a first task, I would like you to get started with creating a checklist for implementing "channels". Given its description and context, do you understand what this task is about? Do you have any questions that we need to clarify before you can start implementing it? If so, we can first work on requirements.yaml together before we continue.

When you are confident that you understand the requirement completely, come up with a checklist for tracking our progress when implementing the requirement. The checklist should

- be linear, so we can work through it top to bottom and use it for guiding and tracking our progress when implementing,
- be complete, i.e. when we have completed each task, the requirement is fulfilled,
- have top-level checkboxes (i.e. not be a numbered list) that each are accompanied by some details (e.g. a list of subtasks, example code, …),
- not group items in sections (e.g. by priority), and lastly
- be understandable for colleagues that have not taken part in this conversation, so when the checklist seems complete to you, take a step back and think for a second: Is the checklist understandable if you come back in a month? If not, what are some details that are missing and which might be helpful to add to understand the task as it was intended?

Finally, when you are confident that the checklist is complete, save it to todo.md and let me know you are done. I will then review it and let you know what I think.
