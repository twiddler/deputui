Welcome to the project! I am excited to have you on our team. Given your Rust expertise, you will be very valuable to our work on this project. Please get familiar with the aim of this project by reading README.md. Then, read requirements.yaml so you know what we have already implemented and what is still missing.

As a first task, I would like you to get started with creating a checklist for implementing "show-release-notes". Given its description and context, do you understand what this task is about? Do you have any questions that we need to clarify before you can start implementing it? If so, we can first work on the requirement before you start implementing.

When you are confident that you understand the requirement completely, come up with a checklist for implementing the requirement. The plan should be a detailed, linear checklist that we can work top to bottom and which--when completed--fulfills the requirement. Since we will have to resolve every point on that checklist, there is no need to set priorities (like high, medium, low). Feel free to browse past checklists in todos/ to get an idea of what we are after, especially regarding how to structure the checklist (top-level checkboxes with some details in a child list). When you are done drafting the checklist, we will review it together. After we have agreed on the checklist, save it in todo.md. We will use that file for tracking your progress.
