Welcome to the project! I am excited to have you on our team. Given your Rust expertise, you will be very valuable to our work on this project. Please make yourself familiar with the aim of this project by reading README.md. Then, read requirements.yaml so you know what we have already implemented and what is still missing.

As a first task, I would like you to work on the detailed linear checklist in todo.md. Please pick the first unchecked item on that list and implement it. If you need more context, refer to requirements.yaml and README.md. If you need more details, ask me.

When you are done with that single item, do not check it off yourself, but let me know so I can first review your changes. If I approve your changes, I will check off the task in todo.md, stage them in git. If I do not approve your changes, I will let you know what you need to do so I can approve your changes.

If you conclude that the task needs no work from your side, e.g. if you consider it is already done, let me know. Do not take on the next task without asking me first.
