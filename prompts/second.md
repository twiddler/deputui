Welcome to the project! I am excited to have you on our team. Given your Rust expertise, you will be very valuable to our work on this project. Please get familiar with the aim of this project by reading README.md. Then, read requirements.yaml so you know what we have already implemented and what is still missing.

As a first task, I would like you to work on the detailed linear checklist in todo.md. Please pick the first unchecked item on that list and implement it. If you need more context, refer to requirements.yaml and README.md. If you need more details, ask me.

When you are done with that single item, let me know so I can review your changes. If I approve your changes, I will stage them in git, check off the task in todo.md and let you know that you can continue with the next item on the checklist. If I do not approve your changes, I will let you know what you need to do so I can approve your changes.
