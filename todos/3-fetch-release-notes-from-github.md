# Implementation Plan for fetch-release-notes-from-github

- [x] Create GitHub API module
  - Add `github.rs` module to `crates/outdatui/src/`
- [x] Parse URLs
  - Parse GitHub repository URL to extract owner and repo
  - Automatically test with a valid https://github.com URL and an invalid https://foo.bar URL.
  - Tests pass
- [x] Response structure
  - Research GitHub API docs for response formats
  - curl an example repository, e.g. `mantinedev/mantine` and see whether the response matches the expectation
  - Add GitHub API response data structures with `serde_json`
- [x] Basic release fetching (without authentication)
  - Implement basic HTTP client using existing `async_h1_client` pattern
  - Try to fetch release 8.3.12 from `mantinedev/mantine`
  - GitHub responds with data that matches the response data structures we defined earlier
- [x] Basic release fetching (without authentication)
  - Adapt the function that fetches releases to fall back to fetching the release tagged with "v" prefix (e.g., "v1.2.3")
  - Try to fetch release v19.1.4 from `facebook/react`
  - GitHub responds with data that matches the response data structures we defined earlier
- [x] Add authentication (for rate limiting)
  - Read API token from `OUTDATUI_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
  - Set proper Authorization header when token is available
  - Provide appropriate user-agent string
